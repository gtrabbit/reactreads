# MyReads Project

This project converts the MyReads starter files into a dynamic React application. The MyReads application allows users to keep track of books they are reading, would like to read, or have read. 

## Getting Started

If you already have Node.js and npm installed, this repository has everything necessary to get started with the MyReads application. Simply clone this repository, cd into that directory and enter `npm install` to install all dependencies, including React, React-Router and Prop-types. When the install has finished, you are ready to launch the local webserver by entering `npm start`. This will open your browser to localhost:3000, displaying the main page of the application. (If not, you may need to open your browser and navigate to localhost:3000 manually). 


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
